            You are a senior software architect.

            Analyze the following Python code:
            ```python
            {code}
            Evaluate the code for the following aspects:

            Is the system modular and well-organized?

            Are there any architectural anti-patterns (tight coupling, poor layering, etc.)?

            Is this code easily scalable and maintainable?

            Suggest improvements to make the system more robust, modular, or scalable.

            Respond with a structured report under headings:

            Architecture Issues

            Scalability Concerns

            Maintainability Feedback

            Suggestions for Improvement """
